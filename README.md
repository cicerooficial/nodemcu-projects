## ESP8266 NodeMCU Projects
`EN`

This repository brings codes and projects developed with NodeMCU/ESP8266 during my workshops at Fab Lab Livre SP.

#### How to run/upload the codes with Arduino IDE:
1. Download the Arduino IDE on https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
2. With the Arduino IDE installed, go to "File > Preferences" and paste the following line on "Additional Boards Manager URLs": http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
3. Go to "Tools > Board: (NameOfTheBoard) > Boards Manager", search for "esp8266" and install the package "esp8266 by ESP8266 Community".
4. With the esp8266 package installed, restart the Arduino IDE and check if the ESP8266 Modules are included in the "Tools > Board: (NameOfTheBoard)" menu.
5. Choose "NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)" and run the code of your choice. :)
